## Introduction

This GitHub repo serves as the development repo for the TRAPI API implementation of BioThings Explorer.

### What's BioThings Explorer

BioThings Explorer aims at helping users querying and linking results from a variety of biomedical relevant APIs through one interface. The project is funded by the [NCATS Translator project](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator).

### What's TRAPI

TRAPI stands for [Translator Reasoner API](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI). It is a standard defined for APIs developed within NCATS Biomedical Translator project to allow easy information exchange among them.

### Our TRAPI Interface

## Current Development Status

Currently, the BioThings Explorer TRAPI API implements TRAPI v0.9.2 standard, and can be queried at https://api.bte.ncats.io/query endpoint.


The TRAPI v1.0.0 standard is currently under development. It can be tested using https://api.bte.ncats.io/v1/query endpoint.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, e.g. npm, installed in your environement.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems

  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

`$ npm install npm -g`
